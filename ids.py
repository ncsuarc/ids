    IDS Camera object

    Provides access to, and control of, IDS machine vision cameras.  This
    class provides as attributes many of the camera settings.  It handles
    image capture internally, and provides methods to get images from the
    camera.

    Arguments:
        logger (optional): logging object to use for log output.
        nummem (optional): Number of memory locations to allocate for storing
            images.
        handle (optional): Image handle to connect to.

            constants.
